Pages represent views use for each specific route pattern. Every file in the pages/ directory represents a different route displaying its content.

To use pages, create pages/index.vue file and add <NuxtPage /> component to the app.vue (or remove app.vue for default entry). You can now create more pages and their corresponding routes by adding new files in the pages/ directory.
